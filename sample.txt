pecific trait, while an allele is a version of a gene, such as T for tall or t for short in the gene for plant height.  

6. A dominant allele shows its effect even if there is only one copy, while a recessive allele only shows its effect if both alleles are recessive, such as TT or Tt being tall, but tt being short.  

7. Homozygous dominant means both alleles for a gene are dominant, such as TT for a tall plant.  

8. Homozygous recessive means both alleles for a gene are recessive, such as tt for a short plant.  

9. Heterozygous dominant can be seen because the dominant allele shows its effect, but heterozygous recessive cannot be seen since it is not a valid genetic state; recessive traits only appear if both alleles are recessive.  

10. The genotype for a heterozygous tall woman would be Tt, and the possible gametes formed in her ovary would be T and t.
